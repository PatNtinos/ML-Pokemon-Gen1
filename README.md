#🧠 ML Pokémon Gen 1

Hellooo there, Pokémon Trainer!
This repository contains my university project on Machine Learning, where I combined classic ML techniques with deep learning, using Pokémon as the core theme! 🐱‍🏍🎮

##🎯 Project Objective

The aim of this project was to learn and apply basic Machine Learning concepts to a topic of our choice.
Being a lifelong Pokémon fan, I decided to explore the world of Gen 1 Pokémon using ML techniques.
Specifically, the classification was based on the Pokemon elemeental types (water,fire,grass,etc.)

##📚 What I Did

🔹 Data Collection & Feature Extraction
Collected images of Gen 1 Pokémon from five Kaggle datasets.

Applied Autoencoders and LDA to extract features.

🔹 Classical ML Models
Used traditional ML algorithms:

+ KNN

+ SVM

+ Linear Regression

+ Naive Bayes

Evaluated performance using metrics:

+ Accuracy

+ Precision

+ Recall

+ F1 Score

🔹 Deep Learning Models
Explored Neural Networks:

+ MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

+ Basic CNN

+ Deep CNN

Achieved 89% accuracy using Deep CNN.

##📌 Notes

+ The data cleaning notebook is not included in the repo.

+ Each notebook is structured to be understandable and reproducible.

+ The report includes detailed steps, challenges, and results.

##🚀 Future Work

+ Classify the images based on the evolution lines (Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard)

+ Classify the whole 151 Pokemon!

+ Extend to other Pokémon generations!
