🧠 ML Pokémon Gen 1
Hellooo there, Pokémon Trainer!
This repository contains my university project on Machine Learning, where I combined classic ML techniques with deep learning, using Pokémon as the core theme! 🐱‍🏍🎮

🎯 Project Objective
The aim of this project was to learn and apply basic Machine Learning concepts to a topic of our choice.
Being a lifelong Pokémon fan, I decided to explore the world of Gen 1 Pokémon using ML techniques.

📚 What I Did
🔹 Data Collection & Feature Extraction
Collected images of Gen 1 Pokémon from five Kaggle datasets.

Applied Autoencoders and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) to extract meaningful features.

🔹 Classical ML Models
Used traditional ML algorithms:

+ KNN

+ SVM

+ Linear Regression

+ Naive Bayes

Evaluated performance using metrics:

+ Accuracy

+ Precision

+ Recall

+ F1 Score

🔹 Deep Learning Models
Explored Neural Networks:

+ MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

+ Basic CNN

+ Deep CNN

Achieved better accuracy through convolutional architectures.

📌 Notes
The data cleaning notebook is not included in the repo.

Each notebook is structured to be understandable and reproducible.

The report includes detailed steps, challenges, and results.

🚀 Future Work
Some ideas to expand this project:

Use transfer learning (e.g., with pretrained models like ResNet).

Try object detection to classify Pokémon in scenes.

Extend to other Pokémon generations!
